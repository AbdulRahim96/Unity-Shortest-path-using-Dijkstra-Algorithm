# Unity-Shortest-path-using-Dijkstra-Algorithm

Steps to implementation:
1. Create a line renderer and check the box for world position
2. Create an empty gameObject and attatch Dijkstra-Algorithm script
3. Create an empty gameObject and attatch Node script and place towards any turning point of your route (e.g road junction)
4. Repeat the process described in step 3 until all nodes are placed at all turning points
5. select each node one by one and add adjecent/neighbor nodes
6. Select gameObject with Dijkstra-Algorithm script attached and add any starting and ending point from any node you want to navigate
